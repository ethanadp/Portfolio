      <description>With a strong background in advanced mathematics and astronomy, I have a deep understanding of complex technical concepts and the ability to effectively communicate these concepts to diverse audiences. My years of experience as a learning and teaching assistant has honed my skills in simplifying technical information for others to understand.
My passion for data analysis was sparked during my studies in advanced electromagnetism and quantum mechanics, where I used Python to analyze data and compare results with fundamental constants.</description>
