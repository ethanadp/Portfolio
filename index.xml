      <description>With a strong background in advanced mathematics and astronomy, I have a deep understanding of complex technical concepts and the ability to effectively communicate these concepts to diverse audiences. My years of experience as a learning and teaching assistant has honed my skills in simplifying technical information for others to understand.
My passion for data analysis was sparked during my studies in advanced electromagnetism and quantum mechanics, where I used Python to analyze data and compare results with fundamental constants.</description>

      <title>Facial Expression AI</title>

      <description>In this project, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and TensorFlow to detect facial keypoints and expressions. The goal of the project was to accurately predict the expression and corresponding facial keypoints for a given image of a human face. The dataset used for training and testing the model included images of faces with different expressions, with a total of approximately 27000 images split across 5 different emotions plus keypoints.</description>
